# Simple Registration Form with Local Storage

This is a basic registration form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It takes user information, validates the input, and stores the data in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Input Fields:** Captures user's name, mobile number, email address, age, and date of birth.
- **Client-Side Validation:** Ensures data integrity by checking:
    - Required fields
    - Name format (alphabetic characters and spaces only)
    - Mobile number format (10 digits)
    - Valid email address format
    - Age range (18-120)
- **Local Storage:** Saves the registration data in the browser's local storage.
- **User Feedback:** Displays error messages for invalid input and provides a success message upon successful submission.

## Files

- **form.html:** Contains the HTML structure for the registration form.
- **script.js:**  Includes the JavaScript code for form validation, data handling, and local storage interaction.

## How to Use

1. **Download or clone the repository.**
2. **Open `form.html` in your web browser.**
3. **Fill in the registration form with valid information.**
4. **Submit the form.** The data will be stored in your browser's local storage.

## Future Improvements

- **Data Persistence:** Explore more robust data storage options like server-side databases for persistent data storage.
- **Security:** Implement security measures such as input sanitization and data encryption for enhanced security.
- **User Interface:** Enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the form.
